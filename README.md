# Multilayer-Perceptron
MLP algorithm implemented in C++. MLP identifies handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The "hello world" of machine learning


MNIST dataset compressed into a ZIP. Will need to unpack this file to run the program. The testing and training data is stored in a .csv format
